<div class="subtitulo2">Esteban Garnica Sánchez</div>
<p class="parrafo">
  A Chilean visual artist (Santiago, 1985) trained at the University of Chile, whose career challenges the conventional boundaries of contemporary art. His work is characterized by a powerful, symbolic visual language that addresses the crucial issues of our time: social inequality, environmental crisis, and urban transformation. In the realm of public art—especially mural painting and urban interventions—his work stands out for its innovation, adaptability, and transformative efficacy, always seeking to awaken consciousness while celebrating the inherent beauty of the world and its communities.
</p>

<p class="parrafo">
  In parallel with his public work, Garnica has built a solid academic corpus that deepens the exploration of contemporary pictorial representation. Through research and experimentation with new media and visual languages, his artistic practice is enriched by the interaction between the public and the academic, enabling him to address social transformation from multiple perspectives and innovative methodologies.
