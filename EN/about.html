<h1 class="titulo">About EGGS-Studio</h1>
<h2 class="subtitulo">The creative universe of Esteban Garnica S.</h2>

<p class="parrafo" style="margin-top:6%;">
  <strong>EGGS-Studio</strong> is a space for creation and visual work led by Esteban
  Garnica S. From here, I develop projects that bring together art, craft, and collaboration with
  people and communities. Through <strong>E.GG.S – Producciones y Art SpA</strong> (RUT 77.973.201-0),
  I offer a diverse body of experience that integrates community muralism, art restoration, teaching,
  exhibition installation, and cultural production. Rather than aiming for grand statements, I focus on
  delivering clear, sensitive, and useful solutions—building relationships and creating spaces where art
  can accompany processes, improve environments, and open new ways of meeting others, and also of meeting myself.

<h3 class="subtitulo2">Esteban Garnica S.</h3>
<p class="parrafo">
  I am a Chilean visual artist (Santiago, 1985), trained at the University of Chile. My work emerges from
  an interest in observing the environment and transforming it through painting, community-based action,
  or discreet (surreptitious) interventions. I move through painting as a primary language, navigating
  muralism, visual research, and teaching—always seeking a balance between the technical, the expressive,
  and the human.
</p>

<p class="parrafo">
  Over the years, I have developed projects that engage with social, environmental, and urban themes from a
  close and collaborative perspective. I believe in art as a tool to improve intimate and everyday life,
  strengthen relationships and identities, and open spaces for reflection. My practice combines early
  experience in street painting, academic training, experimentation, and field work—learning from each
  community and each process.
</p>

<h3 class="subtitulo2">E.GG.S – Producciones &amp; Art SpA</h3>
<p class="parrafo">
  The company was created to provide a professional structure for a practice that has grown over time.
  Through E.GG.S, we develop services related to muralism, restoration, spatial enhancement, artistic
  production, and the design of visual solutions for institutions, communities, and educational projects.
  Our objective is simple: to deliver value in an honest and responsible way—respecting each context and
  ensuring that art becomes a close, accessible, and meaningful experience for those who receive it.
