<div class="titulo">Work Diagram</div>
<div class="subtitulo">
  A visual map of ideas, concepts, and artistic works.
</div>
<p class="parrafo">
  The three categories of my artistic practice are presented in the diagrams. Each category acts as a main axis that connects to its respective series of works and projects. These connections highlight the links between my conceptual, technical, and thematic explorations, reflecting the breadth and depth of my artistic work.
</p>
<p class="parrafo">
  This scheme not only organizes my creative process but also illustrates how core ideas and concepts transform into diverse artistic expressions, providing a comprehensive and coherent vision of my visual practice.
