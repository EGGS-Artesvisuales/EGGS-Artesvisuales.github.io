<h2 class="subtitulo">Artistic practices with social and territorial impact</h2>

<p class="parrafo">
  For centuries, art has been a space for intimate expression and personal reflection. Today, however, many practices move beyond the traditional boundaries of the studio or the exhibition hall. In this shift toward the public sphere, art becomes a tool that engages with place, involves communities, and contributes to collective well-being. Creation moves beyond contemplation to become an act that directly participates in social life.
</p>

<p class="parrafo">
  “Action in the World” understands the artist as an active interlocutor—committed to the places, people, and issues that shape contemporary reality. The work does not only represent; it also participates, proposes, and accompanies processes of transformation. From community muralism to teaching and urban interventions, these practices aim to generate tangible, respectful, and sustained impact over time.

<p class="parrafo">
  This section presents four modalities that structure this approach. Each has its own methodologies, scope, and objectives, yet all share a common purpose: strengthening the social fabric through creativity, craft, and collaboration.
