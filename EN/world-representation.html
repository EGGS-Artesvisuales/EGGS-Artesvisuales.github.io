  Painting—and by extension, visual art—has long served as a window through which humanity observes, understands, and reimagines its reality. From cave paintings to contemporary masterpieces, artists have strived to capture not only the physical appearance of their surroundings but also its symbolic and emotional dimensions. This drive to represent the world—and humanity’s place within it—has led to a continuous evolution of styles, techniques, and aesthetic discourses.

<p class="parrafo">
  Within this context, reflection on the contemporary environment and its phenomena has spurred the development of new forms of visual expression. Today's artistic practices draw inspiration from both traditional painting and media such as installations, photography, video, and various other forms of contemporary art, broadening the possibilities for documenting and critically analyzing reality.

  The primary goal of this category is to capture the essence of our era by examining its defining elements. The creative strategy focuses on representing both the tangible and the intangible, exploring social, cultural, and emotional phenomena that transcend the physical realm. In this way, artistic observation becomes an interpretative experience that deepens our understanding of contemporary reality.

  From this exploration emerge two series of works: one that addresses the tangible and another that deals with the intangible.
