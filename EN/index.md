  <div class="subtitulo">Integrated Visual Arts: Discover ideas, works, and projects.</div>

    <p class="parrafo">
      I invite you to explore this site, where I share the breadth of my artistic activities, from intimate projects to large-scale works. My approach to art is universal, 
      a fertile space where interests, knowledge, and experiences converge.
    </p>
    <p class="parrafo">
      Throughout my career, I have tackled multiple disciplines and areas. This journey led me to create a rhizomatic scheme that classifies the 
      entirety of my work, leaving no cultural activities I have undertaken unrepresented.
    </p>
    <p class="parrafo">
      This scheme not only helps me understand and project my own creative nature but also 
      serves as a tool to present my work in a clear and organized manner.
