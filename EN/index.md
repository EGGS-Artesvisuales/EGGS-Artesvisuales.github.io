<p class="parrafo" style="margin-top: 7%;">
  This is the space where the different dimensions of my work as a visual artist converge.
  Here, intimate projects and large-scale works come together, organized into three axes that structure my practice:
  1) representing the external world, 2) acting in the world, and 3) exploring the inner world.
  Each axis unfolds a particular way of engaging with art and building meaning through the visual.

  I invite you to explore these three axes to get to know my artistic universe: discover works and series, read about my processes, and
  access different ways of engaging with my practice.
  Here you can also acquire artworks and request commissions —paintings, murals, or other interventions— in addition to consulting services
  related to my work, such as restorations and the development of cultural projects.
  This classification functions as a map: it helps me organize and clarify my path, while also making it easier for others to understand how I think,
  produce, and develop each project.
