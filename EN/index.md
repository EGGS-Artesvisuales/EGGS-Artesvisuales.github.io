# Welcome to EGGS - Art Studio

## Discover ideas, works, and artistic projects

<div class="text-container">
  <p>
    I invite you to explore the breadth of my artistic activities, from intimate projects to large-scale works. My approach to art is universal, 
    a fertile space where interests, knowledge, and experiences converge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout my career, I have tackled multiple disciplines and areas. This journey led me to create a rhizomatic scheme that classifies the 
    entirety of my work, leaving no cultural activities I have undertaken unrepresented.
  </p>
  <p>
    This scheme not only helps me understand my own creative nature and the processes behind each production but also 
    serves as a tool to present my work in a clear and organized manner.
