# Welcome to EGGS - Art Studio

## Discover ideas, works, and artistic projects

I invite you to explore the breadth of my artistic activities, from intimate projects to large-scale works. My approach to art is universal, a fertile space where interests, knowledge, and experiences converge.

Throughout my career, I have explored multiple disciplines and areas. This journey led me to create a rhizomatic scheme that categorizes the entirety of my work, without excluding the cultural activities I have undertaken.

This scheme not only helps me understand my own creative nature and the processes behind each production, but it also serves as a tool to present my work in a clear and organized manner.

### Main categories of my artistic practice
